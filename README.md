# Faculty-Presence-Indicator


Faculty Presence Indicator is basically a tool which helps a student to know about the
presence of Faculty in his/her cabin.
There are two major entities in this project, one is the student and other is the faculty. From
student’s point of view, it is a big task to meet the faculty for some doubt or work as faculty
is not always present in cabin and even if available he/she might be busy with their own
work.


Because of this reason the students spend a lot of time waiting outside the faculty’s cabin. In
some cases, the actual work between the student and the faculty is very less, say of five
minutes but for this five minutes of work students waits for an hour or so in some cases. In
such cases there is wastage of student’s time. From faculty’s side it becomes clumsy to meet
students and manage their own work. If a faculty is busy in his/her own work and a student
comes, it might be disturbing or inconvenient. Suppose the faculty is attending a video
conference and in the meanwhile a student comes for some work, it disturbs the conference.
If the faculty has gone for a meeting which is going to take around an hour and student being
unaware of that is waiting outside the cabin for the faculty to arrive. In such cases this tools
comes in very handy.


Using JAVA, a GUI-based desktop application will be created, which would be given to the
faculty. That application will be connected to a database online. Desktop application will
contain various profiles like Available, Busy, Away, Meeting etc. At the student’s side a
basic website would be created where the profile of the faculty would be reflected. Whenever
the faculty updates his/her profiles through the desktop application it would be sent to the
server. From the server it will be directly shown in the website. The whole system will work
on real-time basis.
