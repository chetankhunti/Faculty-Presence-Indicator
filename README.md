# Faculty-Presence-Indicator
Using JAVA, a GUI-based desktop application will be created, which would be given to the faculty. That application will be connected to a database online. Desktop application will contain various profiles like Available, Busy, Away, Meeting etc. At the studentâ€™s side a basic website would be created where the profile of the faculty would be reflected. Whenever the faculty updates his/her profiles through the desktop application it would be sent to the server. From the server it will be directly shown in the website. The whole system will work on real-time basis.
